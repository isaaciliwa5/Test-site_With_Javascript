    <p>This is not Christmas by the way.
        So, jokes on all those who were expecting the fat gifty Santa!
        The obese jackass is still shoving tonnes of overprocessed morsels down his inflamed gut in preparation for his once-in-a-year usefulness.
        What a waste of existence.
    </p>
    <p> For today lets focus on getting you some shots of adrenaline!
        Excited? 
        Didn't think so either. 
        But who cares.
    </p>
    <p>You're probably just feeling bad because your carnal waste of space is used to dopamine and not the good sweet adrenaline that cometh with me.
        Don't worry, you're my friend, I'm not your enemy.
        You are your own enemy and the enemy of my friend is my enemy.
        But, since you're your own enemy then you are my enemy.
        But..! Gaddemmit!

    <p>Anyway, let's get down to business, enough chit chat.
        Here's what I intend to achieve with you:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>I'm gonna inject you with life-long trauma</li>
        <li>after which I'll cause you to hate old men for the rest of your pathetic life</li>
        <li>then I'm gonna give you a nifty little gift of my narcissism which I unavoidably deliver with added spices of saddism</li>
    </ol>

    <p>How am I gonna do it?
        Oh, I thought you might ask.
        Here's how:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>we'll start with psychological torture</li>
        <li>then emotional malaise</li>
        <li>thereafter we conclude with physical immolation in no particular order.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Come on! Why the long face all of a sudden?
        It's gonna be fun. Believe me. I have done this so many times.
        OK, let me give you a little something to cheer you up. Ready?
        Doesn't matter, check this out. This is how you're going to feel after we're done:

    <ul>Books can also be a great way to learn... For those interested, here are the best ones:
        <li>Eloquent Javascript</li> 
        <li>Javascript in Less Than 50 Pages</li> 
        <li>Head First Javascript Programming</li>
